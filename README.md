# NOAA Fire and Life Safety Prediction System (FLPS)

## Project Overview

The NOAA Fire and Life Safety Prediction System (FLPS) is a machine learning-based wildfire risk prediction model designed specifically for Southern California. This project aims to develop a comprehensive evaluation framework for wildfire risk assessment within an 8-week development timeline.

## Objectives

- **Primary Goal**: Construct and validate a predictive model for wildfire risk evaluation in Southern California
- **Timeline**: 8-week development cycle
- **Deliverables**: Production-ready model, comprehensive evaluation metrics, and executive presentation
- **Testing Standards**: Model performance will be evaluated against established test metrics and industry standards

## Geographic Focus

**Target Region**: Southern California

Southern California was selected as the primary study area due to several key factors:

- **Data Availability**: Extensive recent wildfire event data providing robust training and validation datasets
- **Localized Climate Factors**: Unique meteorological conditions including Santa Ana wind patterns that require specialized modeling approaches
- **High-Risk Environment**: Region's susceptibility to wildfire events makes it an ideal testbed for prediction model development

## Technical Infrastructure

**Cloud Platform**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Leveraging GCP's machine learning and data processing capabilities
- Cost-effective development environment utilizing available credits

## Development Principles

### Reproducibility
- All code, data pipelines, and model configurations are designed for full reproducibility
- Standardized development environment setup and dependency management
- Comprehensive documentation of all modeling decisions and methodologies

### Security & Accessibility
- Implementation follows security best practices with no embedded authentication credentials
- Open-source approach ensuring long-term accessibility and maintainability
- Structured for seamless knowledge transfer and continued development
