This repository is dedicated to my overarching project during my internship at NOAA. The following are details about my project.

Overview:
- I have been assigned the task of constructing a model to predict and evaluate wildfire risk in the localized region of Southern California. This model is subject to test metrics and standards, and will be accompanied by a deliverable and presentation.
- All operations will be revolved around GCP.
- It has been consistently established that, in the field of wildfire science, data quality and quantity far outranks model architecture in importance and impact on metrics.

Deliverables:
1. A package of 30-50 datasets in varying degrees of granularity, modality, and spatial and temporal coverage.
2. A meta-learner model combined from the outputs of various base models, each utilized in appropriate situations (example: CNNs for satellite imagery, XGBoost for tabular, etc).

Requirements and Checkpoints:
1. First,
