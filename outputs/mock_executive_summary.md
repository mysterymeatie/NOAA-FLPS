# FPA FOD v6 Augmented Wildfire Dataset - Executive Summary

## Dataset Overview

**Location**: Google Cloud Storage - `gs://fpa_fod_v6_augmented`  
**Status**: Authentication required for access

### Expected Dataset Characteristics

Based on the dataset name and description, the FPA FOD v6 Augmented dataset likely contains:

1. **Comprehensive Fire Records**: Historical wildfire occurrence data across the United States
2. **~270 Attributes**: Including physical, biological, social, and administrative variables
3. **Temporal Coverage**: Multiple decades of fire events
4. **Geographic Scope**: All U.S. states and territories

### Key Attribute Categories (Expected)

#### Ignition Information
- Statistical cause codes and descriptions
- NWCG cause classifications
- Human vs. natural ignition sources

#### Physical/Environmental Factors
- Fire size (acres)
- Fire size class
- Discovery day of year
- Containment day of year
- Weather conditions

#### Biological/Land Cover
- Vegetation types
- Land use categories
- Ecological zones

#### Social Context
- Population density
- Proximity to infrastructure
- Socioeconomic indicators

#### Administrative Metadata
- Reporting agencies
- Source systems
- Data quality indicators

### Analysis Recommendations

1. **Data Access**: Ensure proper GCP authentication before proceeding
2. **Tool Selection**: Polars is ideal for this large dataset due to:
   - Efficient memory usage
   - Fast columnar operations
   - Lazy evaluation capabilities

3. **Initial Exploration**:
   - Start with data profiling to understand distributions
   - Identify key patterns in fire causes and sizes
   - Analyze temporal trends
   - Map geographic hotspots

4. **Advanced Analysis**:
   - Climate impact assessment
   - Human-wildfire interface analysis
   - Predictive modeling opportunities
   - Risk assessment applications

### Next Steps

1. Resolve GCS authentication to access the actual data
2. Review the FPA_Supplement.pdf for detailed attribute definitions
3. Begin with exploratory data analysis
4. Develop specific research questions based on initial findings
